                        <strong>Dear Ma’am</strong>
                        <p>
                            I want to express my heartfelt gratitude for being such an honorable and very approachable teacher during our Grade 10 pandemic year. We currently have an “Honorable Teacher” activity, and you were the very first teacher I thought of messaging. I truly wanted to visit you in your classroom, but due to limited time, I decided to send you this message instead.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thank you so much, Ma’am, for your patience, kindness, and guidance during one of the most difficult times of our lives. You made learning easier, lighter, and more meaningful. You have made a big impact on my life, and I will always be grateful for everything you did for us.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With deepest appreciation,  
                            <br><strong>Your Student</strong>
                        </p>
